<h2>Organ Oasis - Organ donation made easy
<h4>Firebase deployed link for the website is given :- https://test-1-44eaf.firebaseapp.com/ <h4>
<h4>This project focuses on the creation of an online platform for organ donation that is intended to increase the process's efficiency and accessibility. Using concepts of human-computer interaction, the platform facilitates effective communication between donors and recipients. It aims to streamline the organ donation process by integrating registered hospitals onto a single platform, making it easier for users to access all necessary data. The platform is developed in strict accordance with The National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization's recommendations (NOTTO). The platform's user-friendly interface promises a cohesive and trouble-free experience for users. It aims at promoting openness and accountability by ensuring that all pertinent data is freely available to both donors and recipients. In addition, the platform seeks to increase organ donation awareness and donor registration. Clear communication is crucial to the success of the platform, and it is designed with user-friendly interfaces that facilitate clear and efficient channels of communication between donors and recipients.<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
